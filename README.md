# MobileBenchmark
***
Source code for benchmarking mobile frameworks.

This project started with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/rsatter42/status/1233090290862280704) from me asking about benchmarking mobile app frameworks Xamarin and React Native.

The purpose of this project is to measure frameworks used to build apps. While a framework may also be able to run on many operating systems. Right now benchmarks are confined to Android and iOS.
